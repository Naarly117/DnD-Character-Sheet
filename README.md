# DnD-Character-Sheet
A text-based application for creating and saving character information for use with Dungeons and Dragons.

To run: Compile and run Main.java with all other files in the same directory.

Current issue: Due to an issue with the Android IDE this program was coded in, I had to hard-code all file pathways. In order for this code to run on any other system I 
need to modify the code in Main.java to obtain the user's current directory.
